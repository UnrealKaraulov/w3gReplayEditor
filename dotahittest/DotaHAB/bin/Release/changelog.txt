#0.999t
 - Replay Parser (Browser mode): Added "View in WarCraft III" context-menu item to view selected replay directly in war3.
 - Replay Parser: Added "<" (previous replay), ">" (next replay), "view" (view in war3) buttons to be able to easily navigate replays without going back to Browser mode.
 - Replay Parser: Optimized map cache usage (faster parsing).
 - Replay Parser: Opening replay files via windows explorer (when DotaHIT is associated with ".w3g" files) should now be faster.

 - Replay Parser: If replay is opened via double-clicking Replay Finder's result list, then "<" and ">" buttons will navigate in found replays.
 - Replay Parser: Removed 'Extract data from found replays' feature from Replay Finder. It wouldn't really work with replay-stats cache.
 - Replay Parser: New tool added - Replay Statistics. Allows you to view various information about replays you have (hero/player win %, hero pick %, total kills by hero / player, etc.)
 - Replay Parser: Implemented replay-stats cache system (Options->Cache replay stats). This should greatly speed-up replay processing tools (Replay Finder, Replay Statistics).
 - Fixed Replay Parser not saving settings when closing DotaHIT window.
 - Added a fix for blurry hero-stats text in the Options->Settings.
 - Fixed Abyssal Blade not displaying in the shop's item list.
 - Greatly improved DotaHIT stability when loading non-DotA maps/replays (DotaHIT still can't work with them, but you can use generic features like Data Dump, Replay Raw Data Viewer, etc.).
#0.999s5
 - Fixed some "collection was modified" errors that caused DotaHIT to crash.
 - DotaHIT can now load latest AI maps correctly. Also added minimal support for AI replays in replay parser (requested by author).

 - Fixed a few bugs in replay parser.
 - Added a Replay Raw Data Viewer to Replay Parser. Basically it works like integrated dw3gParser's action viewer. UI is mostly 'stolen' from there too ;).
#0.999s3
 - Fixed Item Combining Mode bug in 6.64 that was also causing replays not to parse when map cache is enabled. 
 - Replay Parser: Optimized map cache storage size (x3 smaller) and load time (x2 faster). Old cache files will be automatically overwritten by new cache files.
 - Replay Parser: Fixed some bugs. 
 - You can now use items in the inventory by left-clicking on them (for example to change Power Treads attribute bonus). Item cooldown (if there is) is not supported though.
#0.999s2
 - Replay Parser: Implemented map cache system (Options->Cache maps). This should greatly reduce the replay parse time. Enabled by default.
 - Replay Parser: If the map path provided in the replay does not exist, the default folder is used (Maps\Download) if the map exists there.
 - Replay Parser: Fixed error that prevented replays to be parsed when no map is loaded (replay map not found).
 - Replay Parser: Apm now starts counting after hero pick (the result was lower in -cm).

#0.999s
 - ControlBar default location is above main window instead of below.
 - Fixed Hero Build load.
 - Fixed some abilities based on timers to cause DotaHIT to crash (Craken shell, Balanar skills)
 - Fixed item buy process when there are other heroes picked. Now selected hero always gets the item bought.

 - Replay export now displays bans and picks, and you can customize thier appearance by pressing "bans/picks" button.
 - Hero class and name can be now customized in HeroTags form (requested long ago by daarksidee).
 - Added Hero Format combobox to Replay Export panel. You can customize hero string output in the export.
 - Added "bbC" button to Replay Export panel which allows you to customize bbCode tags for various export data items.
     Use the "preCode" column to enter opening bbcode tag and "postCode" to enter closing bbcode tag.
     Note that since its hard to process all possible bbCode tags the user might enter, bbCode is displayed "as is" in the preview. 
#0.999r5
 - Fixed for 6.62 (1.24b patch). The WarCraft3 path specified in Settings must point to 1.24b Warcraft, otherwise new maps will not load correctly.
 - Added detail-mode for items. You can now view information generally not available in the game. Personally I've waited a long time for this feature , because I wanted to find out the exact duration of MoM, +ms boost of Phase Boots, etc.
 - Fast Item Combining mode is back! And it works a lot better now - it takes almost no time to activate and all (I think) items can be bought instantly without the need to assemble their components.
 - Fixed some bugs in Replay Parser.
 - Replay Parser now detects game mode, replay saver, bans and picks.
 - Changed link to source code in About to sourceforge project. I've moved there from googlecode.
